0.0.6:
* Fixed args for puts/print (completely overlooked 0 args)
* Changed how nested spaces are passed around
* Adding `undent` method to remove indentation from a block (useful for printing to the same line)

0.0.5:
* Fixed a bug with the new bindings by using the def keyword instead of define_method
* Fixed a bug with text being indented extra spaces in certain circumstances

0.0.4:
* Binding indent helper methods to provided blocks rather than executing the block within a Inkjet::Indent.class_eval (fixes issues with losing scope and prevents accidentally messing with the Inkjet::Indent module from within the block)

0.0.3:
* Introduced an Inkjet::Substring class to help manage chunks of strings
* Moved all the stylized stuff to Inkjet::Styles
* Added support for formatters to indentation blocks, to easily format everything within the block

0.0.2:
* Loads of refactoring - completely reworked how formatting and substrings are tracked and updated
* Can now force wrapping of an entire string with a new format, including any previously formatted substrings

0.0.1:
* Initial version of inkjet with support for colors, basic formatting and indentation
